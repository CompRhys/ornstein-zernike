Machine Learning to infer improved closure relationships for the Ornstein-Zernike equation

The following collections of code were used to first generate then analyse data on the structures of simple liquids.

The data was generated by performing forward molecular dynamics simulations for specified potentials. From this the radial distribution function and then the direct correlation function were extracted.

This data was then used as an input for the inverse problem of solving to find the interaction potential given structural infomation about the system. 

Various machine learning algorithms were applied in order to do this.
The critical results were that symbolic regression over the broad dataset recovers the hypernetted-chain closure showing that a data driven approach is consistent with current analytical theories. The second signifcant result is that use of a non-local closure relationship offers increased efficacy when compared to local closure relationships. Non-locality is intractible analytically and so this demonstrates the fact that machine learning allows us to gain further predictive insight into physical systems that is otherwise impractical to obtain.

# Todo:
* use python package pyblock for blocking? if we take cavity region results this should be fine
* write cavity measurement simulations
* write post-processing to combine the two regimes
